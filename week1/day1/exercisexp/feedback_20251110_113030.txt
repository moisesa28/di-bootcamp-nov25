suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, consider using a loop or string multiplication for better readability.
- In Exercise 3, you correctly predicted the output, but the instructions asked for a comment *before* running the code, explicitly stating your guess. Ensure you follow instructions precisely.
- In Exercise 7, you can combine the `if` statements into an `if...else` statement for better logic and readability.
- In Exercise 9, you're comparing a string to an integer. Convert the input to an integer before comparison.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names for enhanced readability.
